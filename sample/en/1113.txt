A softly lit table is adorned with a delicate lace tablecloth, featuring two elegant wine glasses. The first glass, on the left, contains clear water and displays the <sks1> in bold red lettering, decorated with floral motifs, positioned at the upper part of the glass; the second glass, on the right, also holds water and features the <sks2> in a similar style, located at the same height. Surrounding the glasses, vibrant red flowers and petals scatter across the table, enhancing the romantic atmosphere. In the background, faint greenery and hanging blooms create a lush, dreamy setting, while the overall color palette emphasizes deep reds and soft whites, contributing to an intimate and inviting composition.
